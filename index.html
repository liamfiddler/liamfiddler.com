              I'm Liam, a digital designer / developer with over ten years experience engineering, 
              building, and releasing digital products. I've worked with a wide variety of 
              organisations &mdash; from small startups to established, 
              multi-national businesses.

                  I presented a talk at the PolymerSyd meetup in September. The talk detailed 
                  my experiments with the preview version of Polymer's syntactic sugar for 
                  Web Components.

                  I co-founded PolymerSyd &mdash; a quarterly meetup group 
                  for Polymer &amp; Web Component enthusiasts. I also had the 
                  honour of being a speaker at the first event alongside 
                  representatives from Mentally Friendly and Google.

                  To fulfil the written component of a BCA (honours) course I 
                  wrote a thesis about virtual worlds, gamification, &amp; the role of 
                  designers and developers in creation.

                I'd love to catch up and chat about your next big project, what career 
                progression means to you, which comic superhero is due for a good movie 
                adaptation (spoiler; it's Nightwing), when the singularity will occur, 
                the future of internet banking, 
                or anything else that takes your fancy!
